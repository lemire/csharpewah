This is a word-aligned compressed variant of
the Java Bitset class. It uses a 64-bit RLE-like
compression scheme. It can be used to implement
bitmap indexes.

The goal of word-aligned compression is not to 
achieve the best compression, but rather to 
improve query processing time. Hence, we try
to save CPU cycles, maybe at the expense of
storage. However, the EWAH scheme we implemented
is always more efficient storage-wise than an
uncompressed bitmap (as implemented in the java
BitSet class by Sun).


For more details regarding the compressed format, see Section 3
of the following paper:

== Unit testing ==

 Building using Mono


You can build CSharpEWAH using the open source
Mono toolchain using the xbuild command.
Just type xbuild in the main directory. This
should build a C# executable file that you
will then find in a newly created bin 
directory.

$ xbuild


Then you can run the executable using
the mono command:

$ mono ./EWAH.RunTests/bin/Debug/EWAH.RunTests.exe


This will run unit tests.


=== Usage ==

See example.cs.
